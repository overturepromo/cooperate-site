                <p className='basic'>(WAUKEGAN, IL, October 23, 2023) -- Overture Promotions’ 2023 EcoVadis audit resulted in a Silver rating, improving on the company’s Bronze rating from its 2022 audit. EcoVadis is a globally recognized assessment platform that rates businesses' sustainability based on four key categories: environmental impact, labor and human rights standards, ethics, and procurement practices. Overture is now in the 88th percentile of audited companies. </p>
                <p className='basic'>“Overture’s employees and leadership are passionate about doing everything we can to reduce our carbon footprint,” said Jo Gilley, CEO of Overture. “The improvement in our EcoVadis rating is tangible evidence that we are making good progress, and gives us a roadmap to get to a Gold rating.”</p>
                <p className='basic'>In the past year, Overture Promotions has implemented a series of sustainability initiatives as part of its overall Corporate Social Responsibility program, including joining the United Nations Global Compact, a global network of over 15,000 companies that are committed to building a sustainable future. Additionally, Overture plants a tree with every order over $20, in partnership with Ecologi, with over 62,000 trees planted in the carbon offset initiative’s first year.</p>
                <p className='basic'>Overture’s other recent Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives include the development of a DE&I-focused “Viewpoint with Dennis Quaid” episode, which aired earlier this year and was distributed to more than 170 public television stations throughout the United States, reaching 60 million households throughout the year. </p>
                <p className='basic'>The company’s latest CSR initiative is called Overture Women Leaders, or OWL. Its mission is to develop women leaders, providing training such that all of Overture’s women employees are equipped for career planning and progression. It includes a monthly, lunch-time training session, supplemented with one online course per month, along with coaching and mentoring by experienced managers. </p>
                <p className='basic'>“OWL has been a dream of mine for several years, and I’m thrilled that our training team has launched it,” said Gilley. “In our roll-out meetings with front office and frontline women employees, we asked them to rank 14 potential training topics. Their top 3 choices were financial fluency, decision making and building self-confidence, and we are so fortunate to have Nancy Doyle lead the first lunch-time session in mid-November.”</p>
                <p className='basic'>Nancy Doyle is a consultant, author, speaker, and advocate for financial literacy. With thirty years’ experience in investments and wealth management, she has the insight to help people become more knowledgeable and more engaged regarding their personal financial affairs. In her two books, <i>Manage Your Financial Life: A Thoughtful, Organized Approach for Women and Manage Your Financial Life:</i> Just Starting Out, she shares a system for managing finances with real-life experiences to illustrate key concepts.</p>
