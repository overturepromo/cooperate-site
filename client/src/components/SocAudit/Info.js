          Full, Ongoing Commitment to Client Data Security and Privacy

          (WAUKEGAN, IL, March 22, 2024) – Overture Promotions announced the
          successful completion of its SOC 2 Type 2 audit. A Service
          Organization Control (SOC) audit examines a company’s internal
          controls and systems related to security, processing integrity,
          confidentiality, and data privacy.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          The SOC 2 audit was conducted by leading compliance assessor, A-LIGN,
          a technology-enabled security and compliance partner trusted by more
          than 2,500 global organizations to help mitigate cybersecurity risks.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          “Overture is fully committed to meticulous security, data privacy, and
          compliance precautions such that we meet the standards of our most
          security-conscious clients,” said Chris Sheehy, Overture CTO.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          Established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
          (AICPA), the SOC 2 examination is designed to ensure that the personal
          assets of an organization’s potential and existing customers are
          protected. SOC 2 reports are recognized globally and affirm that a
          company’s infrastructure, software, people, data, policies,
          procedures, and operations have been formally reviewed. The Type 2
          audit looks at security over a period of time, vs. the Type 1, which
          looks at a point in time.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          “Congratulations to Overture Promotions for completing their SOC 2
          audit, a widely recognized signal of trust and security,” said Steve
          Simmons, COO of A-LIGN. “It’s great to work with organizations that
          understand the value of expertise in driving an efficient audit and
          the importance of a high-quality final report.”{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          The successful completion of Overture’s SOC 2 audit ensures its
          clients can feel confident their data is secure and protected. As
          Overture continues to expand and invest in innovative technologies,
          data security remains a top-priority within its growth strategy.{" "}
