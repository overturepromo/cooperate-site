          100K Trees Planted in Partnership with Ecologi
        </h4>

          (WAUKEGAN, IL, February 22, 2024) – Overture Promotions proudly
          announces its latest environmental achievement, having successfully
          planted 100,000 trees in partnership with Ecologi, a leading Climate
          Action platform. This significant milestone underscores Overture’s
          commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, as the
          organization actively contributes to global reforestation efforts.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="basic">
          The tree-planting initiative, launched in October 2022, is focused on
          mitigating the impacts of climate change through carbon emission
          offsets. With every order over $20, Overture plants a tree. Every tree
          in the Overture Forest is planted by an Ecologi reforestation partner,
          which hires and trains local people to plant new, native tree species.
        </p>

          “Overture is fully committed to doing everything we can to mitigate
          our impact on the planet,” said Jo Gilley, CEO. “We love that our
          partnership with Ecologi creates jobs, and enables our customers to
          take action with us.”{" "}

          Overture’s newest environmental milestone follows the company’s 2023
          Silver EcoVadis rating, ranking it in the 88th percentile of audited
          companies. EcoVadis is a globally recognized assessment platform that
          rates businesses’ sustainability based on environmental impact, labor
          and human rights standards, ethics, and procurement practices.{" "}

          In the past year, Overture has significantly invested in a series of
          sustainability-related improvements at its Waukegan headquarters,
          including: the installation of state-of-the-art, smart LED lighting to
          significantly reduce energy consumption and bulb usage; an automated
          screen print reclamation system, which reduces water and chemicals
          required to remove ink and emulsion from screens so they can be
          reused; two water bottle refill stations to eliminate the usage of
          single-use plastics at our headquarters; and a robust recycling
          program, largely focused on corrugate materials, with an annual
          recycling volume of 140 tons.{" "}

        <p className="basic">
          Emphasizing its commitment to year-over-year sustainability
          improvements, Overture has also recently announced the creation of a
