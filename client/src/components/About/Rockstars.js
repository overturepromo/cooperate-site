                        <p className="basic">Founded in 2001, Overture began with two women investors, two sales reps and an office manager. The original dream was to create a boutique promotional marketing agency, emphasizing creative and customer service excellence. We realized as we grew that extraordinary customer service requires supply chain control, and we began bringing services in-house. Today, we are a Top 20 promotional products distributor (out of 24,000+ distributors), with 150 employees.</p>
