                <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances. We share personal customer information and/or purchase history only with our agents, representatives, service providers and contractors for limited purposes, including but not limited to: fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with this Site; communicating to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving customers’ shopping experience; administering or facilitating surveys, contests or sweepstakes; offering targeted marketing communications to users that opted-in to receive such communications; enabling access to our partners’ websites; providing a personalized shopping experience; preventing fraud; and completing payment method processing.</p>
                <p>Aside from the purposes described above, we do not share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required to prevent harm or injury (such as product recalls, fraud, claims or other liability), or to comply with legal processes and orders (subpoenas, warrants, and etc.).

We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), an industry-standard encryption method. We do NOT keep your credit card information on file. While we realize this is potentially less convenient for future ordering, we feel that the safest way to protect your credit card information is not to store it, but request it each time your purchase.</p>

                    <li>Disclosing your personal information would interfere with our performance of a greater legal obligation.</li>

                <p>Please note however that we may be barred by law from disclosing certain sensitive information in response to your request.</p>

                <p>2) Verification. After you submit a request, we will promptly take steps to determine whether we can verify that you are who you say you are and, if you are seeking deletion, that your request is genuine. Our process for doing so is as follows: </p>
                <p>We will ask you to provide various pieces of information as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are requesting the Right to Information, we will ask you to provide at least two pieces of information about yourself. If it matches our records, we will verify and proceed with your request.</li>
                    <li>If you are requesting the Right to Access, we will ask you to provide at least three pieces of information about yourself. If it matches our records, we will verify and proceed with your request.</li>
                    <li>If you are requesting the Right to Deletion, we will ask you to provide at least two pieces of information about yourself. If it matches our records, we will verify and proceed with your request. We may also ask you via email to verify your request to delete a second time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>3) We will fulfill your request, either disclosing and delivering a copy of your personal information or information about our privacy practices, both free of charge; or deleting your personal information, within 45 days of receiving your verifiable request. If necessary, we will extend the time period to provide the required information once by an additional 45 days, and will provide you with notice of the extension within the first 45-day period. The disclosure shall cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of the verifiable request. </p>
                <p>Authorized Agent. You have the right to designate an authorized agent to submit an access or deletion request on your behalf. Agents can submit requests as if they were the person they are representing, using the above methods. If you use an authorized agent to submit such a request, we will require that you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide the authorized agent written permission to act on your behalf; and</li>
                    <li>Verify your own identity with us via step 2 of the above procedure before we can honor the request.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>No Discrimination. We will not discriminate against a California resident because the California resident exercised any of the rights described above.</p>
