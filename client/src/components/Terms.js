                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 style={headlines}>Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>The only data we collect and store during normal Web site usage is typical Web server log data. Examples of this type of data are: the name of your Internet service provider, the site that referred you to us, any pages you request, the time and date of those requests, etc. From time to time, overturepromotions.com may conduct surveys, contests and sweepstakes via this Site, email or other media.

                <p>When and With Whom We Share Your Personal Information We never sell or rent your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances. We will share personal customer information and/or purchase history only with our agents, representatives, service providers and contractors for limited purposes, including but not limited to: fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with this Site; communicating to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving customers&#8217; shopping experience; administering or facilitating surveys, contests or sweepstakes; offering targeted marketing communications to users that opted-in to receive such communications; enabling access to our partners&#8217; websites; providing a personalized shopping experience; preventing fraud; and completing payment method processing.</p>
                <p>Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required to prevent harm or injury (such as product recalls, fraud, claims or other liability), or to comply with valid legal processes (subpoenas, warrants) as required by law. We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
                <p>We also contract with third parties to provide us with: data collection and reporting services regarding our customers&#8217; activities on the Site; tracking and measuring performance of our marketing efforts and your response to our marketing efforts; and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These third parties may use cookies and Web beacons (1 x 1 pixels), and may receive anonymous information about your browsing and buying activity on the Site.

If you do not want your non-personal information used to serve ads to you, you can change the settings of your browser to reject cookies.

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 style={headlines}>Purchase Information</h3>
                <p>When you make a purchase from overturepromotions.com, we collect your name and payment method information, such as credit card information. We collect this information in order to bill you for your purchase. We also collect information that allows us to ship your order. This includes the name, address and phone number of the intended recipient(s).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 style={headlines}>Security</h3>
                <p>The SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the most powerful encryption available on the Internet. This means that any information related to your credit card is encrypted when being sent to us, so no one else is able to read it.</p>
                <p>Having a secure server takes the risk out of your credit card transactions. We also do all order processing on software that is separate from the Internet, so there is no danger of anyone gaining access to your order information. We do NOT keep your credit card information on file. While we realize this reducing future ordering convenience, we feel that the safest way to protect your credit card information is not to store it, but request it each time your purchase.</p>
                <p>Please note: that email is not encrypted and not considered a secure way to transmit your credit card information.</p>
                <h3 style={headlines}>Children</h3>
                <p>Users of all ages are welcome to visit overturepromotions.com and view our products. However, supervision of children&#8217;s activities on the Internet is the responsibility of parents or legal guardians to ensure that children do not release personal and/or purchasing information online without permission.</p>
                <p>Overturepromotions.com sells children&#8217;s products for purchase by adults. We do not solicit or collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you must not provide your name, email address, or any other identifying information without the consent of your parent or legal guardian, or as otherwise provided for by applicable law.</p>
                <h3 style={headlines}>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
